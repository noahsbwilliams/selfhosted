Cool tech I use or like for a variety of different uses

## Cloudy Tech (Kubernetes, Functions etc)

[K3s](https://k3s.io/), a tiny, simple, certified, production-ready Kubernetes distro supporting ARM devices as first-class citizens

## Self-hosting

[Inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets), an open-source and self-hostable ingress/firewall-buster proxy.

- Perfect for exposing services on your LAN without actually opening ports on your router. All you need is a single publicly-accessible server somewhere like a [DigitalOcean droplet](https://m.do.co/c/608be2b71903) or a [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=a0e610b5d050b99292c8dc2b4b6da0e8b63405ed) (<-- referral codes that give you some free signup credit).
- Big shoutout to [BattlePope](https://www.reddit.com/user/BattlePope) on Reddit for suggesting this to me as I was banging my head against the wall trying to use SSH port-forwarding.
